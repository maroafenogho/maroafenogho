# 👋 Hi, I’m Maro.
I am a lifelong learner and a <strong>Flutter</strong> developer with experience building mobile and web applications. I am a lover of Riverpod because I love clean and concise code. <br><i>Side Note: I do not hate GetX. 😀 </i>
- I also play around with <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>GoLang</b>.

I talk about flutter development on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@codewithmaro"> youtube </a> channel.
